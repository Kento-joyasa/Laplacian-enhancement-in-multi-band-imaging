the Laplacian filtering image is obtained by 
image convolution using a 3 × 3 Laplacian operator with a surrounding 
value of 1 and a center value of − 8. The Laplacian filter highlights areas 
where intensity changes rapidly. The Laplacian sharpening image is 
generated by subtracting the Laplacian filtering image from the original 
image. The formulas for the Laplace 
enhancement step are as follows: 
![Laplacian Filtering](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\nabla^2%20f(x,%20y)=\sum_{i=-1,%20j=-1}^{1,1}%20f(x+i,%20y+j)-8%20f(x,%20y))

![Laplacian Sharpening](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?g(x,%20y)=f(x,%20y)-\left[\nabla^2%20f(x,%20y)\right])
where f(x, y) is the image after histogram equalization and ∇2f(x, y) is 
the Laplacian filtering image, g(x, y) is the Laplacian sharpening image, 
x and y are the pixel coordinate.
